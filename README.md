# Punk 
## Simplicity Tool Kit

Punk, It is a group of commands line tools, to solve Np-Complete & NP-Hard Problems Easy, 
they are founded, in the ABSTRACT BINARY SEARCH, 
result of 2 years of research, on the universal theory of numbers. 

See ABS in Action https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlkiWQ9QNBo

Punk-Research = Independent + Anarchist + Knowledge

About Me: <Oscar Riveros> 
I'm just what time...

The binaries included are for OS X, you need compile the files for you OS, for SHA3 cracker its necessary Crypto++,

TIP: Optimize Compilation Parameters

# Problems

(See the examples on bin folder for each tool.)

## SSP & SSP_CLUSTER

Subset Sum Problem

Usage: ./abs_ssp universe<path> log<0|1>

universe: 1ยบ value of file is the target, the rest are the set. (only sets no mult-isets)

## OR

Usage: ./abs_or universe<path> pallete<path> zero<number> <0|1>(min, max) log<0|1>

An system [0, 1, -10, 30, 40, 0, 0, 20] with inputs and outputs, 0 are dynamics, 
and can be replaced by any element of the palette, [3, 7, 10, -1, -7],
You need find the minimal or maximal, around a predefined 0, (for example if you need al most 100 on your system and need to find the min, your zero is 100),

(This problem is of my authorship)

## MCP

Usage: ./abs_mcp universe<path> log<0|1>

Separate an set in two set with the same size and same sum. (only sets no mult-isets)

Maximum Constrained Partition (https://www.nada.kth.se/~viggo/wwwcompendium/node152.html)
   

## CRACKER

SHA3 Cracker

Usage: ./abs_cracker hash<path> alphabet<path> kel<number> ker<number> algorithm<224|256|384|512> log<0|1>

hash: File with hashes

alphabeth: a, b, c, d... 1, 2, 3... A, B, C... =)(... etc... (writhe on plain text)

kel, ker: try by yourself, but with 0, 0 is ok (a lot can be shortened with suitable values, time to resolution).

algorithm: SHA3_224, SHA3_256, SHA3_384, SHA3_512 (write only 224, 256, 384, 512)

log: visual loging... 


## PRIMALITY

Composite Number Problem
 
Badass primality test, include all the RSA numbers from wiki, for test.
 
Usage: ./abs_primality numbers<path>
